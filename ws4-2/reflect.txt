After completing this workshop 4 , I have learned several important topics related to object-oriented programming . Firstly, I learned about the concept of a default constructor. A default constructor is a special type of constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler if no other constructor is defined in a class. It initializes the object with default values or performs any necessary setup operations. I understood that it is important to define a default constructor explicitly if other constructors with arguments are defined in the class.Another important concept I grasped during this workshop was the use of a destructor. A destructor is a special member function that is called when an object  goes out of scope. I learned that destructors are used to clean up resources allocated by the object, preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper deallocation. By defining a destructor, we can explicitly specify the necessary cleanup operations for our objects
